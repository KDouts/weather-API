# weather-API
An application that will display current and future weather conditions

When loaded into the page the user is prompted with a text box to search the city they want the weather data for.

When the city is entered into the search bar then the longitude and latitude is entered into the api and retrieves the data for the desired city.

When the api sends back the data for the city the results are presented onto the page for each day that is available.
